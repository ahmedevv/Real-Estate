## Approach taken

#### Overall Design & Accessibility

<p>
ADD
</p>

### Sass
<p>
I used Sass during my final project at General Assembly, and didn't get to play with it like I wanted, so for more practice I decided to use Sass for this project and I enjoyed it.
</p>

## Issues

### Gulp
<p>
I kept getting a 'Task not defined' error when I tried to push my app to Heroku. After researching I found I was using the current version of Gulp but using syntax from the previous version. Updated the syntax, problem solved.
</p>

### Heroku

<p>
I was able to deploy my app to Heroku, but an application error appeared instead of my app. Totally forgot to add a server.js file but also it kept looking for an index.js file which I didn't create for this project. I learned about Procfile and in it, you tell Heroku what to look for and what to do. Once I added that file and installed express, all my issues were solved. Which may have resulted in some happy tears because it took me 4 days to figure this out.
